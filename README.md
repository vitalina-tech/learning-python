#Lucky Prediction
A chaotic little fortune generator.
## What is this?
You run it. It drops random nonsense, wisdom, and sudden sparcks of inspiration.
## Why?
This project is my first public step into Python.
I wanted something small, and self-contained â€” to practice the fundamentals and see a finished result quickly.
## How to run
`bash
python lucky_prediction.py
