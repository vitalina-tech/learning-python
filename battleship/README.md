# Battleship Game
A simple single-player version of the classic game "Battleship".
## What is this
This is a command-line game. You try to guess the location of a hidden ship on a grid by entering row and column numbers.
## What I practiced
- random.randint() - generates a random integer within a specified range.
- list comprehension - compact way to create and fill list.
- nested list - list that contain other lists (useful for grids or tables).
## How to run
```Bush
python battleship.py
