#Unit Converter
A simple unit converter for length units (m, km, cm, mm)
##What I Practiced
- Writing and calling functions using def and return

- Using dictionaries for data lookup

- Applying conditional logic with if / else, in / not in, is / is not

- Handling invalid input with try / except

- Working with input(), float(), .strip(), and .lower() for clean user input

- Returning None when a value is missing or invalid

- Formatting output with f-strings, including .4f for decimal precision

- Using if name == "main": to run code only when the script is executed directly
##How to Run
`bash
python convert_it.py
