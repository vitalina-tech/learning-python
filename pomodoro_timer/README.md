# Pomodoro Timer
## What is this
A terminal Pomodoro timer where you can set:
- Number of focus sessions
- Duration of each focus sessions
- Duration of each break
## What I practiced
### Operators:
- Arithmetic operators - used to perform calculations.
- Assignment operators - used to update values.
- Comparison operators - used to control logic flow in conditionals and loops.
### Data types:
- int for working with numeric input and countdown values.
- f-string formatting for clean and readable output.
### Control flow:
- while...else to manage the countdown loop.
- for loop for running multiple focus and break sessions.
### Escape sequences
- \n - to break lines.
- \r - to update the same line in the terminal.
### time.sleep
Used to pause the program between countdown steps.
## How to run
